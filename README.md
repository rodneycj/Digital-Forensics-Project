# Digital-Forensics-Project
This project was done during our Flatiron School bootcamp.

Abstract: The goal of this lab is to understand how digital evidence is obtained, cataloged and the incident response started in a vritual environment.  

In this lab, we will be reading several papers on digital forensic incident response and then installing the PCAP Analysis for Splunk to digest pcap files into Splunk for analysis. Pcap files are network packet captures. Splunk will ingest these files so you can do an analysis on them. 

The data provided for this lab came from the Western Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition in February of 2019.
